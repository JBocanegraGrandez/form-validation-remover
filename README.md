HTML5 Form validation errors remover
====================================

Simple (really, it's 1 line of JS) extension to **remove HTML5 Form constraints**,
allowing you to submit any form even if there is a `required` attribute or other custom HTML5 input type.

This extension add a `novalidate` attribute on all the forms of the current page.
