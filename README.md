HTML5 Form validation remover
=============================

Simple (realy, it's 1 line of JS) extension to remove HTML5 Form constraints,
allowing you to submit any form even if there is a `required` attribute or other custom type.

This extension add a `novalidate` attribute on all the forms of the current page.

Todo
----

- Better icon
- User feedback (maybe change the icon when all the page forms are no more validated)
